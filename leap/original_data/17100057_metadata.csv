1,"The base population for these projections is derived from the official preliminary postcensal estimates of the population for Canada, provinces and territories as of July 1, 2018. In all scenarios, the population is projected until 2043 for the provinces and territories, and until 2068 for Canada as a whole. For more detail on the assumptions and scenarios, please refer to the projection report (catalogue 91-520) and the technical report (catalogue 91-620). Because of rounding, counts within tables may differ from the totals."
2,"The population is projected until 2043 for the provinces and territories, and until 2068 for Canada as a whole."
4,"The low-growth scenario contains the following assumptions at the Canada level: the total fertility rate reaches 1.40 children per woman in 2042/2043 and remains constant thereafter; life expectancy at birth reaches 85.6 years for males and 88.8 years for females in 2067/2068; interprovincial migration is based on the trends observed between 1991/1992 and 2016/2017; the immigration rate reaches 0.65% in 2042/2043 and remains constant thereafter; the annual number of non-permanent residents reaches 1,080,910 in 2043 and remains constant thereafter; the net emigration rate reaches 0.18% in 2042/2043 and remains constant thereafter."
