1,"Three-year complete life tables are also available in table 13-10-0114 for Canada and all provinces, except Prince Edward Island. For Prince Edward Island and the territories, three-year abridged life tables can be found in table 13-10-0140."
2,"Population estimates are final intercensal up to 2015, final postcensal from 2016 to 2020, updated postcensal for 2021 and preliminary postcensal for 2022. For more details, please refer to the document Methods for Constructing Life Tables for Canada, Provinces and Territories (Statistics Canada catalogue number 84-538)."
3,"Life tables for the years 2021 and 2022 are considered “preliminary”. These tables will be updated at a later time to take into account deaths that could have occurred but have not yet been recorded (late registrations)."
4,"Complete life tables (by single years of age) are available for Canada as a whole and for nine provinces: Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. For Prince Edward Island, Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, abridged life tables (by 5-year age groups) were computed. The population sizes of this province and the three territories were too small to allow the calculation of complete life tables with accuracy. The abridged life tables can be found in table 13-10-0140."
6,"Number of persons in an initial cohort of 100,000 live births who are still alive at the beginning of each subsequent age. The number of survivors decreases as age increases, under the effect of mortality. It is possible to compute, from the number of survivors, the probabilities of survival between two ages. For example, if the number of survivors is 99,297 at age 10 and 98,935 at age 20, the probability of surviving from age 10 to age 20 is 98,935 / 99,297, that is, 0.99635."
7,"Number of deaths which occur at each age, among the initial cohort of 100,000 live births at age 0."
8,"Margin of error associated with the death probability. For example, a margin of error of 0.00020 for a death probability at age 0 of 0.00556 enables the construction of a 95% confidence interval with lower and upper limits of 0.00536 and 0.00576. In other words, the death probability is precise within a range of plus or minus 0.00020, 19 times out of 20."
9,"Number of life years lived by persons between ages x and x + 1. Life years lived are also considered to be the "stationary population" of the life table."
10,"Average number of years remaining to be lived by persons surviving to age x if those persons would experience, during their lifetimes, the mortality observed over the reference period."
11,"Data on deaths that occurred in Yukon and deaths of residents of Yukon that occurred in other provinces or territories are not available from 2017 to 2022. Owing to that lack, life tables have not been calculated for Yukon for reference periods 2015-2017 to 2020-2022. Additionally, data for Yukon was not included in the calculation of life tables for Canada, as well as in the imputation process (used when the population or death numbers were insufficient for a combination of either sex, age and province or territory for these periods)."
12,"Margin of error associated with the life expectancy from age interval i onward. For example, a margin of error of 0.2 on a life expectancy at birth of 81.9 years enables the construction of a 95% confidence interval with lower and upper limits of 81.7 years and 82.1 years."
13,"The single-year life tables are well suited for granular analysis of temporal variations and to single out the most recent trends. However, three-year life tables provide more robust estimates of mortality indicators and time series that are less prone volatility on a short-term horizon (see table 13-10-0114). For these reasons, three-year life tables may be better suited for comparisons between regions or analysis of long-term mortality trends, particularly in less populated provinces."
