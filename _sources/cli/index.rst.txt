Running LEAP
=============================

The main function that you can run via command line:

1. :doc:`--run-simulation <cli-run-simulation>`: run the ``LEAP`` simulation.

The simulation uses a configuration file to set the simulation parameters. The default
configuration file is located at
`leap/processed_data/config.json <https://github.com/resplab/leap/leap/processed_data/config.json>`_.
For more information on the configuration file, see: :doc:`config`.
